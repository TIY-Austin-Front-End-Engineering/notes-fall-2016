# Day 39

## Review

## Challenge
Create a Rot13 decoder. Rot13 is when each character in the alphabet is represented by a character 13 letters later in the alphabet. So A is represented by N and B is represented by O.

```js
rot13('YOU DID IT'); // LBH QVQ VG
rot13('WOO FOR MATH'); // JBB SBE ZNGU
```

if you complete this, make it so you can specify the offset (to something other than 13)

```js
rot13('YOU DID IT', 18); // QGM VAV AL
rot13('WOO FOR MATH', 18); // OGG XGJ ESLZ
```
